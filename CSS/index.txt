Q.What is the difference getElementsById and querySelector?
Ans.
a).Performance

1.getElementById() is faster because it directly accesses elements by their unique ID.
2.querySelector() is slightly slower since it needs to parse the selector.

b. Flexibility
getElementById() is limited to selecting only by ID, which must be unique in the document.
querySelector() allows selecting elements by class, tag, ID, or nested selectors, making it more flexible.
