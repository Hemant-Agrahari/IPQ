Q.What is Pure Component?
A Pure Component is a React component that only re-renders when its props or state change, based on a shallow comparison. It helps improve performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.

How to Create a Pure Component:
Class Component:
Use React.PureComponent instead of React.Component.
Functional Component:
Use React.memo() to make it behave like a pure component.


Q.What is Controlled Component?
ans:
A Controlled Component is a component  that is controlled by React state and props rather than managing its own state or relying on the browser's default behavior.
This keeps React as the single source of truth for the component's data and UI behavior.
example:
Form

Q.What is Context API?
ans.
The Context API is a built-in feature that allows components to share data (state, props, functions, etc.) across the entire component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.It provides a way to manage global state in a React application, acting as a lightweight alternative to state management libraries like Redux.

When to Use Context API:
When you need to share data across multiple components without prop drilling.
For features like:
1.User authentication
2.Theme toggling
3.Localization
4.Application settings


Q.What is the defference between Redux and Context API?
When to Use Context API
1.Small to medium applications.
2.When you only need to manage simple, localized global state (like theme toggling or user authentication).
3.If performance optimization isn't critical.

When to Use Redux
1.Large-scale applications with complex state management requirements.
2.When state is frequently updated by multiple components.
3.Need for predictable and testable state management.
4.Want advanced debugging and middleware support.

Q.what is memo and usememo?
ans:
memo()
Definition:
React.memo() is a higher-order component (HOC) that wraps a functional component and prevents unnecessary re-renders by performing a shallow comparison of props.
Key Use Case:
It improves performance by skipping the re-render when props remain the same.

usememo()
Definition:
useMemo() is a React hook that memoizes the result of a computation to avoid unnecessary recalculations during rendering.

Key Use Case:
Optimize expensive computations inside components.

How it Works:
useMemo() memoizes the expensiveCalculation result and recomputes it only when count changes.


Q. What is Document Object Modal?
Ans.
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree-like hierarchy of nodes, where each node corresponds to elements, attributes, or text within the document. The DOM allows developers to access, manipulate, and dynamically update the content, structure, and style of web pages using languages like JavaScript.
